Instructions
We will create a simple Django-based web application to manage information about different people.

Here is the structure of the project

people_project/            # Main project directory
  └── env/                 # Virtual environment directory
  └── people/              # Django project directory
      ├── info/            # Django app directory
      │   ├── templates/   # Directory for HTML templates
      │   │   ├── person.html
      │   │   ├── people.html
      │   │   ├── all_people.html
      │   ├── views.py     # App views file
      ├── people/          # Django project settings directory
      ├── manage.py        # Django project management file
      └── people_project/  # Main project virtual environment activation script


Part 1
Create a new directory for your project called people_project and navigate into it.

mkdir people_project
cd people_project


Create a new virtual environment and activate it.

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


Install Django.

pip install django


Create a new Django project called people.

django-admin startproject people


Navigate into the people project directory and create a new app called info.

cd people 
python manage.py startapp info


Open the people/settings.py file and add the info app to the INSTALLED_APPS list.

...
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'info',
]
...


Copy and paste the following variables into a file info/views.py

name = 'Bob Smith'
age = 35
country = 'USA'


create a view display_person(request) related to the /person URL. It should render the information about the person 
in the person.html template.

Part 2
Copy and paste the following variables into a file info/views.py

people = ['bob','martha', 'fabio', 'john']


create a view display_people(request) related to the /people URL. It should render the information about the people 
in the people.html template.
The people should be sorted alphabetically
their name should be capitalized (use built-in template filter)

Part 3
Copy and paste the following variables into a file info/views.py

all_people = [
  {
    'id': 1,
    'name': 'Bob Smith',
    'age': 35,
    'country': 'USA'
  },
  {
    'id': 2,
    'name': 'Martha Smith',
    'age': 60,
    'country': 'USA'
  },
  {
    'id': 3,
    'name': 'Fabio Alberto',
    'age': 18,
    'country': 'Italy'
  },
  {
    'id': 4,
    'name': 'Dietrich Stein',
    'age': 85,
    'country': 'Germany'
  }
]


Create a view display_all_people(request) related to the /all_people URL. It should render the information about the 
people sorted by their age, in the all_people.html template.
Finally, remember to update the URL configuration in people/urls.py to map the new views to URLs.
