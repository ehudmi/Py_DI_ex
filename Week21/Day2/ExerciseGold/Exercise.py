# Exercise 1 : Upcoming Holiday
# Instructions
# Write a function that displays today’s date.
# The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming holiday and print which
# holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
# Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.


# Exercise 2 : How Old Are You On Jupiter?
# Instructions
# Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
# Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
# Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
# Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
# Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
# Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
# Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
# Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
# Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
# So if you are told someone is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, the function should output that they are 31.69 Earth-years
# old.


# Exercise 3 : Regular Expression #1
# Instructions
# Hint: Use the RegEx (module)

# Use the regular expression module to extract numbers from a string.

# Example

# return_numbers('k5k3q2g5z6x9bn')
# // Excepted output : 532569


# Exercise 4 : Regular Expression #2
# Instructions
# Hint: Use the RegEx (module)

# Ask the user for their full name (example: “John Doe”), and check the validity of their answer:
# The name should contain only letters.
# The name should contain only one space.
# The first letter of each name should be upper cased.


# Exercise 5: Python Password Generator
# Instructions
# Create a Python program that will generate a good password for you.

# Program flow:

# Ask the user to type in the number of characters that the password should have (password length) – between 6 and
# 30 characters.
# Validate the input. Make sure the user is inputing a number between 6 to 30. Create a loop which will continue to
# ask the user for an input until they enter a valid one.

# Generate a password with the required length.

# Print the password with a user-friendly message which reminds the user to keep the password in a safe place!

# Rules for the validity of the password

# Each password should contain:
# At least 1 digit (0-9)
# At least 1 lower-case character (a-z)
# At least 1 upper-case character (A-Z)
# At least 1 special character (eg. !, @, #, $, %, ^, _, …)
# Once there is at least 1 of each, the rest of the password should be composed of more characters from the options
# presented above.

# Create a test function first!

# Do the following steps 100 times, with different password lengths:
# Generate a password.
# Test the password to ensure that:
# it fulfills all the requirements above (eg. it has at least one digit, etc.)
# it has the specified length.
