Hi, I went over your hackathon there are no special comments that I can add, it was really good for a short hackathon just I would extract all the managment of fetching the data from the api at different module you can give it the name api or any other meaningful name.
we can add some imporvments that the code will look better for example for this code:
if figure.image_url == "":
    return get_image(request, figure.name, figure.pk)
else:
    context["figure"] = figure
    return render(request, "fight/battle_screen.html", context)
the else is redundant because you do return before it then it can be like this:
r this code:
if figure.image_url == "":
    return get_image(request, figure.name, figure.pk)

context["figure"] = figure
return render(request, "fight/battle_screen.html", context)
