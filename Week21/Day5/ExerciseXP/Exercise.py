# Exercise 1 : Restaurant Menu Manager
# Instructions
# Description: Create a restaurant menu management system for a manager. The program should allow the manager to view
# the menu, add an item and delete an item.


# PART 1
# In this exercise we will use PostgreSQL and Python.

# Create a new database and a new table in pgAdmin (or in psql). The table is named Menu_Items and contains the columns

# item_id : SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
# item_name : VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
# item_price : SMALLINT DEFAULT 0

# In the file menu_item.py, create a new class called MenuItem, the attributes should be the name and price of each
# item.


# Create several methods (save, delete, update) these methods will allow a user to save, delete and update items from
# the Menu_Items table. The update method can update the name as well as the price of an item.

# In the file menu_manager.py, create a new class called MenuManager
# Create a Class Method called get_by_name that will return a single item from the Menu_Items table depending on it’s
# name, if an object is not found (there is no item matching the name in the get_by_name method) return None.

# Create a Class Method called all_items which will return a list of all the items from the Menu_Items table.


# Codebox:

# item = MenuItem('Burger', 35)
# item.save()
# item.delete()
# item.update('Veggie Burger', 37)
# item2 = MenuManager.get_by_name('Beef Stew')
# items = MenuManager.all()


# Part 2
# Create a file called menu_editor.py , which will have the following functions:
# show_user_menu() - this function should display the program menu (not the restaurant menu!), and ask the user to :
# View an Item (V)
# Add an Item (A)
# Delete an Item (D)
# Update an Item (U)
# Show the Menu (S)
# Call the appropriate function that matches the user’s input.

# add_item_to_menu() - this function should ask the user to input the item’s name and price. This function will not
# interact with the menu itself, but simply create a MenuItem object and call the appropriate function from the
# MenuItem object.
# If the item was added successfully print a message which states: item was added successfully.

# remove_item_from_menu()- this function should ask the user to input the name of the item they want to remove from the
# restaurant’s menu. This function will not interact with the menu itself, but simply create a MenuItem object and call
# the appropriate function from the MenuItem object.
# If the item was deleted successfully – print a message to let the user know this was completed.
# If not – print a message which states that there was an error.

# update_item_from_menu()- this function should ask the user to input the name and price of the item they want to
# update from the restaurant’s menu, as well as to input the name and price they want to change them with. This
# function will not interact with the menu itself, but simply create a MenuItem object and call the appropriate
# function from the MenuItem object.
# If the item was updated successfully – print a message to let the user know this was completed.
# If not – print a message which states that there was an error.

# show_restaurant_menu() - print the restaurant’s menu.

# When the user chooses to exit the program, display the restaurant menu and exit the program.
