# Exercise 1 : Authentication Database


# Instructions
# PART 1: Authentication CLI - Login:
# Create a dictionary that contains users: each key will represent a username, and each value will represent that
# user’s password. Initialize this dictionary with 3 users & passwords.
# Create a loop that does the following:
# If the user inputs “exit”, break out of the loop.
# If the user inputs “login”, ask them for their username and password.
# If the user’s details exist print “you are now logged in”.
# If the user is successfully logged in, store the username in a variable called logged_in so we can track it later.


# PART 2 : Authentication CLI - Signup:
# Continuation of the Exercise Above - Authentication CLI - login

# If the user does not exist ask if they would like to sign up:
# Ask the user for a username and make sure it doesn’t exist as a key in our dictionary, if the username is not valid
# continue asking the user to input a username.
# Ask the user for a password. The password is the value.


# PART 3 : Database
# Replace the dictionary of users with a database table.

# Create the functionality which will allow us to read and write users to and from the database.

# Bonus: Try and encrypt the users password before storing it in the database.
