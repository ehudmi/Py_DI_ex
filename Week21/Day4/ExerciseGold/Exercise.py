# Exercise 1 : Restaurant Menu Manager
# Instructions
# Description: Create a restaurant menu management system for a manager. The program should allow the manager to view
# the menu, add an item and delete an item.

# The menu should be saved to a local file – the program should load the file when it begins and add the updated
# details to the file before exiting.

# The program should be written in two files – one which will deal with the UI (user interface), eg. showing the user
# menu and getting user input, etc.
# The second file will handle all other functionality such as adding/removing items from the menu, along with loading
# and saving the data to a JSON file.
# Separating the files is important – the file which deals with the UI functionality should not have any details about
# the menu file itself (encapsulation).

# The following code is the basic menu for a restaurant. You can make any changes you want.

# {
#     "items": [
#         {"name": "Vegetable soup", "price": 30},
#         {"name": "Hamburger", "price": 44.9},
#         {"name": "Milkshake", "price": 22.5},
#         {"name": "Artichoke", "price": 18},
#         {"name": "Beef stew", "price": 52.5},
#     ]
# }


# Create a JSON file called restaurant_menu.json. Paste the menu provided above in the restaurant_menu.json file.

# Create a file called menu_manager.py. The file should contain a class called MenuManager, with the following
# functions:

# __init__() - The function should read the menu from the restaurant_menu.json file and store it in a variable called
# menu.

# add_item(name, price) – this method should add an item to the menu, although do not save the changes to the file
# yet.

# remove_item(name) – if the item is in the menu, this function should remove it from the menu (and again do not save
# the changes to the file yet) and return True. If the item was not in the menu, return False. (Hint: use Python’s del
# operator).

# save_to_file() - When the manager is finished updating the menu this function should be called and it should save all
# the updates and write them into the the restaurant_menu.json file (ie. the file which holds the menu).

# Create a file called menu_editor.py , which will have the following functions:
# load_manager()- this function should create a new MenuManager instance.

# show_user_menu() - this function should display the program menu (not the restaurant menu!), and ask the user to
# choose an item. Call the appropriate function that matches the user’s input.

# add_item_to_menu() - this will ask the user to input the item’s name and price. It will not interact with the menu
# itself, but simply call the appropriate function from the MenuManager object.
# If the item was added successfully print a message which states: item was added successfully.

# remove_item_from_menu()- this function should ask the user to input the name of the item they want to remove from the
# restaurant’s menu. The function should not interact with the menu itself, but simply call the appropriate function
# from the MenuManager object.
# If the item was deleted successfully – print a message to let the user know this was completed.
# If not – print a message which states that there was an error.

# show_restaurant_menu() - print the restaurant’s menu.

# When the user chooses to exit the program, first write the menu to the file and then print a message that states that
# the menu was saved, finally exit the program.

# After exiting the program the changes should be reflected in the menu (see Part 1.1) and in the JSON file.

# Here’s an example of the menu shown to the user:

# Exercise 2 : Giphy API #1
# Instruction
# Hint: For this exercise, check out the documentation of the Giphy API
# https://developers.giphy.com/

# You will work with this part of the documentation
# https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search

# You will use this Gif URL:
# https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=hilarious&rating=g&api_key=hpvZycW22qCjn5cRM1xtWB8NKq4dQ2My
# Explanation of the Gif URL

# q Request Parameter: Search query term or phrase. We are searching for “hilarious” gifs

# rating Request Parameter: Filters results by specified rating. We are searching for Level 1 gifs. Check out the
# ratings documentation
# https://developers.giphy.com/docs/optional-settings/#rating

# api_key Request Paramater : GIPHY API Key. Our API KEY is hpvZycW22qCjn5cRM1xtWB8NKq4dQ2My
# Fetch the giphs from the Gif URL provided above.

# Use f-strings and variables to build the URL string we’re using for the fetch.
# If the status code is 200 return the result as a JSON object.
# Only return gifs which have a height bigger then 100.
# Return the length of the object you received in the previous question.
# Only return the first 10 gifs. Hint: In the Giphy Documentation, check out the relevant Request Parameters.


# Exercise 3 : Giphy API #2
# Instructions
# Hint: For this exercise, You will work with this part of the documentation
# https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search
# You will use this API KEY : hpvZycW22qCjn5cRM1xtWB8NKq4dQ2My

# Create a small Python program which asks the user for a term or phrase and returns all the relevant gifs. (Example:
# all the “hilarious” gifs)
# If the term or phrase doesn’t exist or if the user didn’t enter a correct term or phrase, return the trending gifs of
# the day and a message stating that you couldn’t find the requested term or phrase.
# Note from the documentation : GIPHY Trending returns a list of the most relevant and engaging content each and every
# day.
